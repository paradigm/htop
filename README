Fork of htop-dev which adds a Bedrock Linux stratum column.

To enable the column, hit or select:

- `F2`
- `Columns`
- `Available Columns`
- `STRATUM`
- `F5`
- `Active Columns`
- `STRATUM`
- `F7`/`F8` as desired

Limitations:

- Seeing the stratum of other user's processes requires root permissions.
	- `brl which` can avoid this, but the technique it uses is problematically slow for `htop`
- Even with root permissions this may not detect the stratum of sandboxed processes.

If you're building on Bedrock, don't forget to `strat -r`, e.g.:

	strat -r debian sh -c './autogen.sh && ./configure && make && sudo cp ./htop /usr/local/bin/'

Introduction
------------

`htop` is a cross-platform interactive process viewer.
It requires `ncurses`.

For more information and details on how to contribute to `htop`
visit [htop.dev](https://htop.dev).

Build instructions
------------------

This program is distributed as a standard autotools-based package.
For detailed instructions see the [INSTALL](/INSTALL) file, which
is created after `./autogen.sh` is run.

When compiling from a [release tarball](https://github.com/htop-dev/htop/releases/), run:

    ./configure && make

For compiling sources downloaded from the Git repository, run:

    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make

By default `make install` will install into `/usr/local`, for changing
the path use `./configure --prefix=/some/path`.

See the manual page (`man htop`) or the on-line help ('F1' or 'h'
inside `htop`) for a list of supported key commands.
